#### Description:
A smart platform for managing stock and consumables in a company.   
As an employee, you can quickly notify management about the lack of a certain item at the "coffee-station" near your office (e.g. No more milk). __The Front Office__     
As a company, you save money with the help of accurate predictions of the quantity needed by day. Special cases such as high-consumption periods (internships) or low (holidays) will be taken into account to keep away from overspending. __The Back Office and The Science Office__
